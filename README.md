# Spring-Boot-Jorney

This repository documents my learning journey through a Spring Boot course on Udemy.  
I have purchased a Udemy course by John Thompson and will also study Spring Boot in the subject <a href="https://github.com/QuiteNew/Fullstack-Flux-The-Rapid-Developer-Education-Program/tree/main/Computer%20Interface%20Programming"><u>Computer Interface Programming</u></a> which will help my journey. 
The goal is not only to complete the course, but to truly understand the concepts by practicing, organizing the material, and revisiting it when needed.
Each section of the repository follows the course structure and includes notes, exercises, and small projects that reflect my progress over time.  
This serves as mainly a study archive and progress tracker, but also a long-term reference for Spring Boot development.


## About the course

The course will help me develop my own roadmap to learn about how backend applications are made and when they are deployed, using or through the Spring framework. I will experience the point at which all of these areas (web applications, APIs, databases, security, testing, and microservices) connect to create a whole.
The structure of the roadmap is to first review the basics of each of these areas before going into more advanced techniques such as Reactive Programming, Microservices, Event Driven Programming and deploying with Docker and Kubernetes. I will be documenting my exercises, notes, and projects along the way to provide a theoretical understanding and a practical experience as I progress through this course.
At the end of this course, I expect to be confident in my ability to create complete Spring Boot applications, and to also have an understanding of how all professional backend applications are created, tested, secured and deployed. This roadmap I will use as my learning log, future resource material for any projects I may complete in the future, and lastly as proof of my work completed during this course.

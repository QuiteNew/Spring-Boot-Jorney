# Spring-Boot-Jorney

This repository documents my learning journey through a Spring Boot course on Udemy.  
I have purchased a Udemy course by John Thompson and will also study Spring Boot in the subject <a href="https://github.com/QuiteNew/Fullstack-Flux-The-Rapid-Developer-Education-Program/tree/main/Computer%20Interface%20Programming"><u>Computer Interface Programming</u></a> which will help my journey. 
The goal is not only to complete the course, but to truly understand the concepts by practicing, organizing the material, and revisiting it when needed.
Each section of the repository follows the course structure and includes notes, exercises, and small projects that reflect my progress over time.  
This serves as mainly a study archive and progress tracker, but also a long-term reference for Spring Boot development.


## About the course

The course will help me develop my own roadmap to learn about how backend applications are made and when they are deployed, using or through the Spring framework. I will experience the point at which all of these areas (web applications, APIs, databases, security, testing, and microservices) connect to create a whole.
The structure of the roadmap is to first review the basics of each of these areas before going into more advanced techniques such as Reactive Programming, Microservices, Event Driven Programming and deploying with Docker and Kubernetes. I will be documenting my exercises, notes, and projects along the way to provide a theoretical understanding and a practical experience as I progress through this course.
At the end of this course, I expect to be confident in my ability to create complete Spring Boot applications, and to also have an understanding of how all professional backend applications are created, tested, secured and deployed. This roadmap I will use as my learning log, future resource material for any projects I may complete in the future, and lastly as proof of my work completed during this course.


## Key Takeaways

Through this course, I will learn about the current back-end programming techniques as well as the Spring Boot framework. I will also learn about the development of real-world applications, how to write the code for the application, how to develop the structure of the application, and finally how to deploy it.

**Core Spring Topics**

* Learn about the Dependency Injection & IoC concept. Apply it to design your application for efficiency and modularity.
* Learn to write clean and well-structured code without having to write 'boilerplate' code (or the basic structure code) again in the Spring framework.

**Web Development Using Spring Boot**
* Learn to develop applications from 'scratch'.
* Learn to develop 'REST' based API's in Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux, and Spring WebFlux.fn.
* Learn to apply reactive programming and functional programming concepts to new web applications using these frameworks.

**Managing Data in Spring with JPA & MongoDB (via Spring Data)**
* Spring Data JPA (for relational database storage) and MongoDB (for NoSQL database storage) both provide data storage options.
* Spring Data R2DBC allows for reactive relational database storage options.
* You will need to create ‘Flyway’ scripts to implement data transitioning between the various versions of your database, as well as verify that your database’s data is valid by applying ‘Java Bean Validation’.

**Securing Applications via Spring Security**
* To secure application(s) from unauthorized use, use Spring Security to implement either an HTTP Basic Authentication or use OAuth2/JWT Authentication.
* Secure applications developed using different frameworks (ex. Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux, Spring WebFlux.fn).

**Web Tools for REST**
* Use tools like RestTemplate and WebClient in order to consume other APIs using the RESTful web service design.
* Set Up Methods of Authenticating RESTful and Non-blocking/Reactive Requests within your Application

**Testing and Best Practices**
* JUnit and Mockito can be used for application testing. Spring MockMVC can be used for controller tests.
* Use Lombok will reduce boilerplate code, and improve the ability to map objects with MapStruct.

**Advanced Features**
* Spring Boot Actuator will be used to monitor your applications.
* Apache Kafka will be used with an Event-driven Architecture and Microservices.
* Spring-ai will be used to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) intoapplications.
* The Spring Cloud Gateway can control the traffic to applications.
* Caching/Events can also be used to develop a more efficient system.

**Deployment**
* Docker is used to create application as an image and then run it within a Docker container.
* Docker Compose manages multiple containers.
* Kubernetes to deploy application(s) so that they are production ready.
* Log structured logs to help in the monitoring and maintaining of your systems.

## Projects 
Throughout the course, I'll complete 18+ Spring Boot projects that demonstrate real-world backend development and allow me to aquire knowledge of various topics. These projects are as simple as web apps and as complex as secured web apps with databases, microservices, and containers.
As I work on these larger projects, I'll do smaller exercises as well as experimentation before moving on to the larger project. These smaller projects help me better understand a particular topic before the larger projects show a deeper understanding of application structure, API design, data storage, authentication, testing, and deployment. <br>
The projects I complete for this program will form the basis of my backend development portfolio.
